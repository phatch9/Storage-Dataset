Isolation: Isolation refers to the principle that a transaction should be executed in isolation from other transactions. 
This means that the changes made by a transaction should not be visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed. 

- For example, consider two transactions that update the same row in a database table. 
If the first transaction updates the row but does not commit the changes before the second transaction updates the same row, 
the second transaction may read inconsistent data.


demonstrates isolation and ACID properties using Java and a relational database. Suppose we have a database table called accounts with the following columns: id, name, and balance. We want to transfer money from one account to another and ensure that the transaction is isolated from other concurrent transactions. Here's an example implementation using Java and JDBC: import java.sql.*; public class IsolationACIDExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Connection conn = null; try { conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password"); conn.setAutoCommit(false); // set auto-commit to false for transaction // retrieve account balances PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = ?"); stmt.setInt(1, 1); ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery(); rs1.next(); int balance1 = rs1.getInt("balance"); rs1.close(); stmt.setInt(1, 2); ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery(); rs2.next(); int balance2 = rs2.getInt("balance"); rs2.close(); // transfer money from account 1 to account 2 int transferAmount = 100; if (balance1 >= transferAmount) { PreparedStatement updateStmt = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE accounts SET balance = ? WHERE id = ?"); updateStmt.setInt(1, balance1 - transferAmount); updateStmt.setInt(2, 1); updateStmt.executeUpdate(); // simulate a delay to allow another transaction to read the old balance Thread.sleep(5000); updateStmt.setInt(1, balance2 + transferAmount); updateStmt.setInt(2, 2); updateStmt.executeUpdate(); conn.commit(); // commit transaction System.out.println("Money transferred successfully"); } else { System.out.println("Insufficient funds"); } } catch (SQLException | InterruptedException e) { try { if (conn != null) { conn.rollback(); // rollback transaction on error } } catch (SQLException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try { if (conn != null) { conn.close(); } } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } } In this example, we start by establishing a connection to the database and setting auto-commit to false to enable transaction management. We then retrieve the balances of the two accounts using a prepared statement. Next, we perform the money transfer operation by updating the balances of the two accounts using two update statements within the same transaction. If the balance of account 1 is sufficient for the transfer, we subtract the transfer amount from account 1 and add it to account 2. We then simulate a delay of 5 seconds to allow another transaction to read the old balance of account 1. After the delay, we update the balance of account 2 and commit the transaction to make the changes permanent in the database. By introducing a delay between the updates to account 1 and account 2, we simulate a concurrent transaction that reads the old balance of account 1 and tries to transfer money to account 2. If the transaction isolation level is set to READ_COMMITTED, the concurrent transaction will read the updated balance of account 1 and transfer money based on the new balance. However, if the isolation level is set to SERIALIZABLE, the concurrent transaction will block until the first transaction is committed, ensuring that the two transactions are executed in a serializable order. By ensuring that the transactions are isolated from each other, we can be sure that the money transfer operation will be executed correctly and that the database will remain consistent and ACID-compliant, even in the face of concurrency and system failures.
